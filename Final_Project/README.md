FINAL PROJECT README


This final project can be broken down into 3 distinct parts.

Part 1) Assembling a training data set using x-ray emission spectra from various Ni, Fe and Mn standards across a range of various experiments, and packaging everything up into h5 format. (Please see Step_1_Assembling my training data.ipynb) 

Part 2) Building a ML model that, when fed an XES spectrum, can predict which standard it most likely resembles.
(Please see Step_2_Final_project_generating_model.ipynb) 

Part 3) Integrating this model into a Flask-based web app, where users may upload their own spectra and get a breakdown of what it *most likely* resembles. (Please see Step_3_Final_project_flask)
