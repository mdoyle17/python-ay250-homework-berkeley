FINAL PROJECT README

This final project can be broken down into 3 distinct parts.

Part 1) Assembling a training data set using x-ray emission spectra from various Ni, Fe and Mn samples across a range of experiments, and packaging it up into h5 format.

Part 2) Building a ML model that, when given an XES spectrum, can predict what sample it is from. 

Part 3) Integrating this model into a Flask-based web app, where users may upload their own spectra and get a breakdown of what it is most likely to be.
